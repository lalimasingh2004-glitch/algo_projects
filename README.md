#  Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-Means Clustering

![Customer Segmentation Overview](1.png)

##  Project Overview
This project performs **customer segmentation analysis** on mall customer data using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**.  
The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their demographics and spending behavior to enable **targeted marketing strategies**.

---

##  Dataset
**Size:** 200 customers  
**Features:**
- **CustomerID** â€“ Unique identifier for each customer  
- **Gender** â€“ Male/Female  
- **Age** â€“ Customer age in years  
- **Annual Income (k$)** â€“ Annual income in thousands of dollars  
- **Spending Score (1â€“100)** â€“ Score assigned based on customer behavior and spending nature  

---

##  Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and explored the customer dataset  
- Checked for missing values and data quality  
- Prepared features for clustering analysis  

### 2. Optimal Cluster Selection
- Applied the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters  
- Analyzed the clustering score vs number of clusters  
- Selected **5 clusters** based on the elbow point

### 3. K-Means Clustering
- Implemented K-Means with **5 clusters**  
- Visualized cluster formation and centroid movement  
- Plotted customer segments based on **Annual Income** vs **Spending Score**

### 4. Cluster Analysis
- Analyzed **age distribution** across clusters using box plots  
- Examined **gender distribution** within each cluster

##  Key Visualizations
1. **Elbow Method Plot:** Shows optimal cluster selection at k=5.  
2. **Customer Segmentation Plot:** 2D visualization of clusters and centroids.  
3. **Age Distribution:** Variation in age across clusters.  
4. **Gender Distribution:** Gender ratio per segment.

##  Results

- Identified clear **customer segments** based on income and spending behavior  
- Found patterns like:
  - High-income, high-spending premium customers  
  - Moderate-income, budget-conscious customers  
  - Low-income, low-spending conservative customers  
- Visualized results using scatter plots for easy interpretation
